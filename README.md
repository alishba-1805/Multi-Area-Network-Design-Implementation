## Project Overview

This project implements a large-scale enterprise network consisting of **four distinct routing domains** interconnected through route redistribution. The design serves **11 subnets (Networks A-K)** across multiple departments, using **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Masking) for efficient IP allocation from a single Class A address space.

| Border Router | From to To | Command | Context |
|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Router2 | EIGRP 5 to OSPF 1 | `redistribute eigrp 5 subnets` | `router ospf 1` |
| Router2 | OSPF 1 to EIGRP 5 | `redistribute ospf 1 metric 1500 100 255 1 1500` | `router eigrp 5` |
| Router10 | EIGRP 5 to OSPF 1 | `redistribute eigrp 5 subnets` | `router ospf 1` |
| Router10 | OSPF 1 to EIGRP 5 | `redistribute ospf 1 metric 1500 100 255 1 1500` | `router eigrp 5` |

## Security Implementation

### NAT (Network Address Translation) - Router17

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Type | Static NAT |
| Inside Local | 1.139.135.189 |
| Inside Global | 72.195.221.244 |
| Inside Interface | Fa0/0 (Network J) |
| Outside Interfaces | Se0/0/0, Se0/0/1, Se0/1/0 |

### ACL 1 - Block Single Host (Router4)

Blocks Laptop2 (72.2.0.10) from reaching Server0 (72.0.0.2):

```
access-list 100 deny ip host 72.2.0.10 host 72.0.0.2
access-list 100 permit ip any any
! Applied inbound on Fa0/1
```

### ACL 2 - Block Entire Subnet (Router7)

Blocks all of Network D (72.14.0.0/16) from reaching Server0:

```
access-list 101 deny ip 72.14.0.0 0.0.255.255 host 72.0.0.2
access-list 101 permit ip any any
! Applied inbound on Fa0/0
```
